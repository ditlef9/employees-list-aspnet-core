## üõ†Ô∏è 4 How I created the application

Visual Studio > New Project > Language: C# > Project Types: Web > `ASP.NET Core Empty`


**Adding views to a controller function**<br>
For each controller i went to the function example `public IActionResult Index()`, right clicked
and selected add `Razor View - Empty`.

**Creating Entities, Controllers and Services**<br>
Country and Person is created as Entities<br>
Next I added controllers for Person named `PersonsController.cs`.

I then added services for `CountriesService.cs` and `PersonsService.cs`.

**Adding Views**<br>
The views are located under `Views` directory. Persons-views are the 
important views. 


**Database with SQL Server**<br>

I installed drivers for SQL Server:<br>

`dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`

The DB Sets are located in the file
`Entities\PersonsDbContext.cs`.
