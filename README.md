## ‚û°Ô∏è 4 Key Differences Between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core  

üèõÔ∏è ASP.NET MVC is a framework built on the .NET Framework and works only on Windows. 
It uses a monolithic architecture, relies on IIS for hosting, 
and offers limited support for dependency injection. 
Development is primarily done in Visual Studio, and the framework is no longer actively updated or supported, 
making it less suitable for modern web applications.  

üåê ASP.NET Core, on the other hand, is a cross-platform, high-performance framework built on .NET Core. 
It features a modular architecture, supports multiple hosting options like Kestrel and IIS, 
and includes built-in dependency injection. ASP.NET Core supports development on various IDEs, 
such as Visual Studio Code, and is actively maintained with regular updates, 
making it ideal for modern and cloud-based apps.
