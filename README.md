## üõ†Ô∏è 3 How I created the application

Visual Studio > New Project > Language: C# > Project Types: Web > `ASP.NET Core Empty`


**Adding views to a controller function**<br>
For each controller i went to the function example `public IActionResult Index()`, right clicked
and selected add `Razor View - Empty`.

**Creating Entities, Controllers and Services**<br>
Country and Person is created as Entities<br>
Next I added controllers for Person named `PersonsController.cs`.

I then added services for `CountriesService.cs` and `PersonsService.cs`.

**Adding Views**<br>
The views are located under `Views` directory. Persons-views are the 
important views. 


**Database with SQL Server**<br>

I installed drivers for SQL Server:<br>

`dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`

The DB Sets are located in the file
`Entities\PersonsDbContext.cs`.

## ‚û°Ô∏è 4 Key Differences Between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core  

üèõÔ∏è ASP.NET MVC is a framework built on the .NET Framework and works only on Windows. 
It uses a monolithic architecture, relies on IIS for hosting, 
and offers limited support for dependency injection. 
Development is primarily done in Visual Studio, and the framework is no longer actively updated or supported, 
making it less suitable for modern web applications.  

üåê ASP.NET Core, on the other hand, is a cross-platform, high-performance framework built on .NET Core. 
It features a modular architecture, supports multiple hosting options like Kestrel and IIS, 
and includes built-in dependency injection. ASP.NET Core supports development on various IDEs, 
such as Visual Studio Code, and is actively maintained with regular updates, 
making it ideal for modern and cloud-based apps.
